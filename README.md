## Usage

### Packaging Presets
This example packs a directory and an addtional file preset skipping the first 10 Amplifire slots:
```
AtomicUtils pack -t MyPackage.abu -d Path/To/TonsOfPresets -f OneMorePreset.pre -o 10
```
You can specifiy as many -d and -f options as you like.

### Set Every Preset
This example takes a preset file `Default.pre` and packages it into an abu file at every slot.
This is useful for clearing out the Amplifire totally.
```
AtomicUtils setall -t Blank.abu -f Default.pre
```
